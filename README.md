# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This project serves as a comprehensive collection of my journey through Machine Learning, focusing on practical implementations, theoretical understanding, and essential concepts. Currently, I am exploring **Feature Engineering**, with plans to cover more advanced topics as I progress.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. **Feature Engineering**

Feature engineering is a crucial step in building efficient machine learning models. This section includes:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Strategies like mean/mode imputation, KNN, etc.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, target encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Min-max scaling, standardization, and robust scaling.
- **Feature Selection**: Methods like correlation analysis, chi-square test, and feature importance from models.
- **Derived Features**: Creating new features from existing ones.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

Core steps to prepare raw data for machine learning models:

- Data cleaning
- Normalization and transformation
- Outlier detection and handling

### 3. **Model Implementation**

Step-by-step implementations of machine learning models, including:

- Regression (Linear, Logistic)
- Classification (Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)
- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)

### 4. **Notebooks and Experiments**

Interactive Jupyter notebooks documenting:

- Problem-solving approaches
- Experiments with different datasets
- Evaluation metrics and results

## Key Features

- **Real-world examples**: Includes practical examples and datasets for hands-on learning.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Detailed explanations of methods and approaches.
- **Modular code**: Easy-to-understand and reusable code snippets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.8)
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pritam-Stats/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning
```

### Running the Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
```
I am using Jupyter Notebook in VS Code. Earlier I was using Google Colab. The Advantage of google colab is there we don't  need to install separately everything is available to import directly also we get a more powerful kernel than our usual local machine. But I have used colab for quite some time and now i wanted to shift to vs code. (This might get tricky and time consuming some times in setting up the environment.)
```

Open any notebook under the `notebooks` directory to explore the content.
